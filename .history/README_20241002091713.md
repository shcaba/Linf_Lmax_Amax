# Linf_Lmax_Amax
Interpreting plausible Linf from Lmax and Amax values
There are many instances where the Lmax value is lower than the estimated Linf.
Likewise, there are many instances where the assumed Amax results in a size smaller than Linf.
Questions being asked here are: 
* How often does this occur in big databases like FishBase?
* Can one estimate a reliable Linf from Lmax values that are smaller than Linf?
* What does it mean for analyses such as length-based methods if the M value results in Amax that leads to a length less than Linf?
